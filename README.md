# DETECTION_DEMO

## Getting Started

This is my graduate project for [DLSchool](https://www.dlschool.org).
It is a demo-server where you can make predictions of specific classes by neural detector YoloV3.
Image as input, return the same image with detection boxes on it.


## Installation

First of all you must be in directory, where this repository does. 

### For Windows users:

```
coming soon
```

### For Linux users:

```
bash /your/path/to/detection_demo/install.sh
```

That's all what you need for server installation. From this moment you can go to the local server **127.0.0.1:5000** and check detector by yourself!

## Usage

If you complete installation above, you do not need to relauch this code everytime. Installed server can be started like that:

### For Windows users:

```
coming soon
```

### For Linux users:

```
bash your/path/to/detection_demo/run.sh
```

The server based on address **127.0.0.1:5000**
